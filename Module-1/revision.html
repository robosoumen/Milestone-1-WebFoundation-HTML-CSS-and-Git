Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents <small>designed</small> to be displayed in a web browser. <em>It defines the content and structure</em> of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
